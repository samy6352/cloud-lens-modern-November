"""The provisioning script must derive the same export names the app does.

infra/focus-exports.ps1 creates the Cost Management exports CloudLens imports from. The app
recognises an export as its own by hashing the destination and comparing the name
(schedules.owned), so the two derivations have to agree exactly — in a different language, in a
different process, at a different time.

If they ever drift the failure is silent and expensive: the script reports success, Azure
writes the reports, and CloudLens ignores them as another deployment's data. Nothing errors.
Somebody notices weeks later that Hourly Billing is still empty.

These tests read the real script rather than a copy of it, so editing either side breaks them.
