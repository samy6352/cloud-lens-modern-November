"""The refresh has to *report*, and the RBAC snapshot must not stall the page.

Two faults found on the live deployment sat behind these three seams.

`/api/warehouse` was the whole of "Quick refresh doesn't work". The refresh ran and the data
landed; the endpoint simply did not return any of the fields the header reports with, so the
progress strip said "Starting..." for the entire run and the outcome -- rows loaded, reason
for a failure, whether the archive was written -- was never shown at all.

The durable job identity closes the window between accepting a job and its first progress
update. The browser must not accept a previous run's finished state or lose a failed run.

`EntraSSO._serve_stale` is why tabs went slow on a five-minute rhythm: revalidating the RBAC
snapshot discarded it first, under a per-session lock, and `permitted()` is the first line of
nearly every endpoint.
