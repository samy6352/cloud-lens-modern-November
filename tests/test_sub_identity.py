"""One subscription, one identity.

Azure spells a subscription id two ways. FOCUS exports use the ARM path
`/subscriptions/<guid>`; the Query API, Cost Details reports and Azure's own ActualCost
exports use the bare GUID. Both are correct.

Storing them verbatim put one subscription in the table twice. Every write replaces the range
it covers with `WHERE "SubAccountId" = ?`, so a FOCUS load never deleted the report path's rows
and the report path never deleted FOCUS's -- both survived, and both were summed.

Observed live, on one subscription:

    11111111-...                 11,266 rows   $1,917.07
    /subscriptions/11111111-...   6,219 rows     $981.96

The dashboard read $920.98 for a month Azure billed at $476.07. Nothing errored, no tab looked
broken, and a doubled total still looks like money -- which is why this needs tests rather than
eyes.
