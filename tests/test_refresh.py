"""
Checks on the Refresh control.

Every bug this covers presented the same way: you click Refresh, the spinner runs, it stops, and
the numbers are unchanged with no error anywhere. That is the worst failure mode this app has,
because it is indistinguishable from the button not being wired up at all.

  * ingest() ended with `{**state, "status": "ready", **summary()}`. summary() carries no status
    of its own, so "ready" was hardcoded: an ingest where every subscription failed still
    reported success, and the UI -- which only ever tested status == "failed" -- silently redrew
    the same data.

  * The finished-state message was written to `error` by the export path and `detail` by the API
    path, and the export handler merged into the previous state. A stale `detail` from an earlier
    run could therefore outrank the current `error` and describe the wrong failure.

  * Outcomes were reported with notify(), which prepends a banner into #tabBody. On a partial
    refresh the loadTabs() immediately after wiped it before it could be read.

Run: python test_refresh.py
