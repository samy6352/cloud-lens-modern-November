"""Does the daily archive keep exactly one copy per dataset per day?

The interesting failure is not a crash. It is an archive that silently accumulates a file per
button press, or one that overwrites yesterday's copy with today's -- either of which destroys
the only reason the archive exists, which is being able to say what the numbers were on a
given day.

# cloudlens-test: requires-azure

# Two of the checks below need a configured archive account, and `conftest.py` scrubs
# `ARCHIVE_*` out of the environment deliberately -- so without this marker the file could only
# ever pass on a machine whose shell happened to have those variables set, and failed for
# everyone else. A test that depends on the developer's own environment is the exact failure
# `conftest.py` exists to prevent; declaring the dependency is how a test says so.
