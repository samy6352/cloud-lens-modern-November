"""The opening view — the one screen most people will judge the product on.

It is also the densest: six figures, a two-series trend and five tables, all from a single
warehouse pass. These checks are about the things that would quietly make it wrong rather than
make it fail — a total that doesn't match its parts, a change computed against the wrong
window, or the partial final day of a cost export plotted as if spend had collapsed.
