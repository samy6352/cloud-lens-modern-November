"""Where the warehouse stores its rows.

The warehouse used to be a DuckDB file and nothing else. That is a good engine
for this workload and a bad thing to hand to a customer: it is an embedded
library on the app's own disk, which means the data lives inside the compute,
there is nothing for a customer's DBA to back up, monitor or restore, and it is
not a component Microsoft ships to them.

So the rows live in Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server, and nowhere
else. DuckDB was kept for a while as an opt-in local engine, which turned out to
cost more than it saved: it was the engine the whole test suite actually
exercised, so PostgreSQL-only faults -- COPY TO for the archive, the interval
syntax, TRY_CAST(... AS JSON) -- reached the deployed app without a single test
failing, and were all found by reading logs. One engine means the suite tests
what runs.

Everything above this module is written against one small interface, which is
the DuckDB connection API it was already written against:

    con.execute(sql, params) -> cursor with .fetchall/.fetchone/.fetchmany
    con.close(), and use as a context manager

`PostgresConnection` presents exactly that over psycopg, translating the SQL on
the way through (see sqldialect). That interface is kept rather than rewritten
because it is a few hundred call sites across two dozen query modules, and none
of them need to know how the rows are stored.

Authentication has no password in it. PostgreSQL is deployed with password
authentication disabled outright, and the app presents an Entra token from its
managed identity instead -- so a customer deployment has no database credential
to store in app settings, rotate, or leak.

        A connection in an aborted transaction is rolled back first: PostgreSQL refuses every
        subsequent statement on it otherwise, and the next borrower would inherit a session that
        fails everything for no visible reason.

        `statement_timeout` is reset for the same reason the temp objects are dropped. It is
        set per checkout by readers, and the next borrower may be a rebuild that runs for
        several minutes; inheriting a dashboard's limit would abort it. `RESET` rather than
        `DISCARD ALL`, which would also throw away the search path and `work_mem` that
        `_open` established for the life of the connection.
