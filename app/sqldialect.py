"""Run the application's DuckDB-flavoured SQL on PostgreSQL.

DuckDB itself is gone -- PostgreSQL is the only engine. What remains is the dialect:
a few hundred statements across two dozen query modules were written against DuckDB,
and this translates them on the way to the server. It is not a second backend and
there is nothing to choose between.

Why a translator rather than 200 edits
--------------------------------------
The dashboard, waste, tags, uptime, commitments and savings modules contain a few
hundred SQL statements written against DuckDB. Most of that SQL is already
portable -- it is ordinary aggregation over quoted column names -- but a handful
of constructs are not, and they are scattered through every one of those files:

    round(sum("BilledCost"), 2)          PostgreSQL has no round(double, int)
    strftime("ChargePeriodStart", '%Y-%m')   no strftime at all
    regexp_extract(s, p)                 spelled substring(s from p)
    regexp_matches(s, p)                 spelled s ~ p
    json_extract_string(doc, '$.k')      spelled doc #>> '{k}'
    TRY_CAST(x AS DOUBLE)                no TRY_CAST
    ?                                    placeholders are %s

Rewriting every call site would touch thousands of lines across two dozen
modules, and would have to be repeated -- wrongly, eventually -- by anyone adding
a query later. Translating in one place instead means new SQL can be written in
the dialect the codebase already uses, and there is exactly one thing to test.

The translation is deliberately narrow. It is not a general SQL rewriter: it
handles the closed set of constructs this application actually uses, and leaves
everything else untouched. Anything it does not recognise reaches PostgreSQL
verbatim and fails loudly there, which is the right outcome -- a translator that
guesses is worse than one that declines.

String literals, quoted identifiers and comments are never rewritten. That is
what makes the difference between a translator and a find-and-replace: a tag
value of `round(x, 2)` or a meter named `20 ?` is data, and passes through
unchanged.

    `bind` says whether the caller is passing parameters, and it decides how `%`
    is treated. psycopg only interprets `%` as a placeholder marker when
    parameters are supplied; with none, the string is sent verbatim. So escaping
    unconditionally is wrong in the parameterless case -- `i % 365` was sent as
    `i %% 365`, which PostgreSQL rejects with "operator does not exist: integer
    %% integer", and `LIKE '/subscriptions/%'` became `LIKE '/subscriptions/%%'`
    and only survived because two wildcards happen to match what one does.

    Placeholder rewriting is last either way: every step above may introduce `%`
    characters of its own -- to_char templates, regex patterns -- and those need
    escaping exactly once, along with the ones already in the statement.

    The translation is a pure function of its two arguments, and a request re-sends the
    same statements -- the reader's currency views alone are 30k characters, translated on
    every connection. Remembered results skip that; a statement that fails to translate
    raises every time, because a raised call is never cached.
