"""Hour-billed usage by resource, meter and day, so the Uptime tab need not read `costs`.

Why
---
The Uptime tab asked four questions of the detail table on every load. On the 16.9M-row
estate that took longer than the 120s origin budget, so the tab returned HTTP 500 to
every viewer, warm or cold -- a failed response is never cached, so nothing ever
improved it.

What it is
----------
Only rows whose unit is a pure duration (`uptime.HOUR_UNIT`), grouped to the columns
the tab reads, with `BilledCost` and `PricingQuantity` summed. Measured on one real
month:

    detail rows                  5,813,121
    hour-billed rows               986,145
    this grain                     632,719   (0.11 of the month)

Summing is exact for everything the tab computes. Its hours are
`PricingQuantity * multiplier(UnitOfMeasure)`, and the multiplier is constant within a
group because the unit is part of the grain, so the product of the sums is the sum of
the products. The same query runs against this table or against `costs` and returns
the same rows.

`Tags` is deliberately absent. It averages ~1KB per row and differs between rows of
the same resource on the same day (per-job tags on Databricks clusters), so carrying it
would have made this table nearly as large as the detail table. Tags come from
`resource_tags` instead.

`ChargeCategory` and `PricingModel` are carried so the whole filter bar can be served
here: without them a `charge` or `pricing` filter would send the tab back to `costs`.
