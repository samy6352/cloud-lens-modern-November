"""The dashboard behind the tabs: the same warehouse, arranged rather than asked.

The chat is good at questions nobody anticipated. It is a poor way to answer the four things
everyone wants the moment they open a cost tool — what am I spending, on what, where is it
going up, and what is idle. Those belong on a page you can read without typing.

Every figure here comes from the warehouse, so a tab renders in milliseconds and the
model is not involved at all. The one exception is stale resources, which needs live inventory
from Azure because "this disk is attached to nothing" is not a fact the cost export knows.

Grouping follows Azure's own `ServiceFamily`, with one rule that matters for a cost tool:
**every currency unit lands in exactly one tab.** People add tabs up and expect the total, so
anything not claimed by a named group falls into "Other" rather than quietly disappearing.

        Ranking is done by taking the top rows per currency rather than by
        numbering every row and discarding almost all of them. The two select the
        same rows in the same order -- the ORDER BY is unchanged -- but they cost
        very different amounts: numbering requires the whole input sorted, while a
        bounded `ORDER BY ... LIMIT` lets PostgreSQL keep a heap of `limit` rows
        and never sort the rest.

        On the live estate the top-resources query groups 507,846 rows to publish
        twenty of them. Sorting all of it took 5.9s, of which about 3.9s was libc
        string comparison. `COLLATE "C"` would have removed most of that too, and
        was measured saving 4.0s in 7 of 7 paired runs -- but it changes which of
        two equal-cost rows wins and the order the currency groups come out in.
        This changes neither.

        The threshold is found with `ORDER BY ... LIMIT 1 OFFSET n-1`, which both
        PostgreSQL and SQLite answer with a bounded heap of n rows. `LATERAL` would
        read better and SQLite does not have it; these queries run against SQLite in
        the offline tests, so the portable spelling is the one that can be tested.

        `cut` is `MATERIALIZED` and that is not optional. Left inlinable, PostgreSQL
        pushed the threshold subquery into the join filter and evaluated it once per
        candidate row rather than once per currency: the estimate went to 4.4e11 and
        the live query, measured at 6.2s before this change, was still running after
        879 seconds. Materialising it makes the same query 1.4s.

        Rows at the threshold are kept with `>=`, so ties spill through and the
        window below still trims to `limit`. That keeps the boundary behaviour
        identical to ranking everything: the same rows survive, in the same order,
        with the same ranks.

        `grouped` is `MATERIALIZED` because it is read three times here and the
