"""Azure Cost Management queries, scoped to whatever the caller can see.

Deliberately narrow: this module answers money questions and nothing else. It runs as the
**signed-in person** when one is present — their delegated ARM token is carried on a ContextVar
and used in preference to the server's own credential — and as the server (az login / managed
identity) for background work. Either way "subscriptions I have access to" is simply whatever
Azure returns, so there is no separate permission model here to get wrong.
