"""Billing's own measures, precomputed, so the statement need not re-derive them.

Why
---
`billing.build` issues one statement that classifies every row in two calendar
months and then aggregates it fifty ways. On the deployed lab estate of 13,556
rows that is imperceptible. On the real 5,811,998-row estate it is not:

    the Billing statement, detail table     451 s
    the same statement, from this table     see `billing.build`

It returned HTTP 500 under the server's 110s `statement_timeout`, and without the
cap it ran for six and a half minutes. Production never showed it because
production holds the lab data.

What actually costs
-------------------
Not the grouping. The measure set expands to **315 `FILTER` predicates**, and each
is evaluated against every row -- so the cost follows the row count, not the number
of groups. The daily series is the proof: it produces **93 rows** and still takes
**519.8s**, because it reads the same 5.8M rows to do it.

That is also why three rewrites all failed. Splitting the `GROUPING SETS` into one
pass per bucket measured 485s against the 451s baseline, and a two-stage
rank-then-measure plan took 282s for the resources bucket alone against 146s. Both
*added a pass*, and a pass over the detail table is precisely what is expensive.

An earlier round of probes concluded the opposite -- that the aggregates were
cheap and the 2M-key grouping was the cost. Those probes wrapped the query in
`SELECT count(*) FROM (...)`, which lets PostgreSQL discard the unused aggregate
expressions entirely: `EXPLAIN VERBOSE` shows 315 FILTER clauses selected directly
and none through the wrapper. Every number taken that way was measuring the
`GROUP BY` alone. Recorded here because the same trap is waiting for the next
person who benchmarks this table.

The grain, and what it cost
---------------------------
Measured on the real estate over the two months a statement reads, 5,817,991 rows:

    (currency, subscription, resource)              2,032,131
    + day, cost basis                               2,277,255   +12.0%
    + resource group                                2,773,754   +21.8%
    + service, region, charge category, pricing     2,800,170   +0.95%

The last four dimensions are nearly free once `ResourceGroup` is paid for, and
they are what lets this table narrow itself by the filter bar instead of handing
every filtered statement back to the detail table. So the grain is the whole set.

2.08x fewer rows is not much of a compression, and that is not the point: this
estate genuinely holds 2,032,125 distinct resources, so no table keyed by resource
can be smaller. The saving is that the 315 predicates are evaluated once at ingest
rather than on every page load.

What it deliberately does not hold
----------------------------------
With CLOUDLENS_ENV_ROLLUP enabled the normalized environment joins the grain.
Its source remains the legacy four-spelling Tags expression, evaluated during
preprocessing rather than reclassifying raw charges for every filtered statement.

The classification is absent from the grain for a happier reason: it is already
*inside* the measures. `reservation_savings_total` was filtered to
`kind = 'reservation'` when it was computed, so re-aggregating it sums only
reservation rows without needing `kind` as a column. Measured, carrying the
classification explicitly added no rows at all.

    The date predicate goes *inside* the CTE rather than around it, so a windowed
    rebuild prunes to the matching `costs_fact` partitions instead of normalising
    a year of rows and discarding all but a month.

    The measures are cast to `double precision` in an outer projection rather than
    left as `_sql_measures` writes them. Seven of the fifty are `count`s and so
    arrive as `bigint`, while `table_sql` declares every measure `double precision`
    -- a difference `INSERT INTO ... SELECT` used to absorb silently by coercing to
    the declared type. A full rebuild is a `CREATE TABLE AS`, which takes its types
    from the query instead, and without this cast the swap fails outright:
    `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW` will not change a published column from `double
    precision` to `bigint`.

    Casting here rather than in `_sql_measures` keeps the live Billing statement's
    SQL exactly as it was, and has the further effect of making the computed
    fallback in `_shadow_billing_rollup` agree with the stored table column for
    column -- which it did not before.

    The projection is over the aggregated rows, not the detail table, so it costs
    a pass over the grain rather than over the estate.

    Materialize only the grain and financial inputs, not the wide raw ``valued``

    repeatedly normalizing the same tokens. On a complete real 151,410-row day,
    this narrow boundary reduced all-measure aggregation from 29.23 s to 1.65 s;
    materializing all valued columns took 2.79 s. The shared billing expressions
