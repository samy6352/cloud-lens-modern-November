"""Cost grouped by the tags on the resources that incurred it.

The interesting question is not "what did tag X cost" but "what did the resources carrying
these tags cost, together" — and that is a set question, asked repeatedly as someone adds and
removes tags. Answering it server-side would mean a round trip per click.

So the server answers once, with the pieces the client needs to answer every later question
itself: each resource, its cost, and which tag keys it carries. Selecting a tag is then an
intersection over a few thousand small objects, which is instant and stays instant offline.

Two things worth knowing about Azure tag data:

  * Tags arrive as a JSON object per cost row, e.g. {"Environment":"prod","Owner":"ana"}. A
    resource appears on many rows, so cost has to be summed per resource before anything is
    counted, or a resource billed daily looks thirty times more expensive than one billed once.

  * Tag keys are not case-normalised by Azure: `Environment`, `environment` and `ENVIRONMENT`
    are three distinct keys on three resources, and treating them as one would silently merge
    what a governance report needs to keep apart. They are kept separate, and the UI shows them
    as they are.

  * **A tag only reaches cost data by riding on a usage record.** Tagging a resource does not
    backfill the usage it has already emitted, and a resource emitting no usage — a deallocated
    VM, a free tier, anything stopped — carries its tags nowhere. So a tag can be correct, live
    on the resource, and completely absent from cost. Showing only what cost data knows means
    someone who tagged something an hour ago sees nothing and concludes the feature is broken.
    `live_tag_keys` exists to close that gap: it asks Azure what tags actually exist so the tab
    can say "this tag is real, it just has no spend behind it in this window" rather than
    staying silent.
