"""Native FX sufficient statistics; never persist display-rate money.

The ordinary cost grain loses invoice FX provenance. This companion keeps each
provider exchange rate and eligible legacy USD ratio separate, so the warehouse's
row-aware conversion can run on aggregates without substituting today's rates for
invoice rates. Resource money and Billing's independent measures still fall back.

On by default: without it every converted read scans the raw month three times
(authority check, scoped rollup, the report itself). `CLOUDLENS_FX_ROLLUP=false`
opts out. An estate that predates it keeps exact raw conversion until its next
full derived rebuild fills the table; nothing is read from it before then.
