"""Scheduled Cost Management exports, created and owned by CloudLens.

Why this exists: refreshing through the Cost Details API means asking Azure to *generate* a
report and then waiting for it. One report is about forty seconds; a three-month refresh across
three subscriptions is nine of them, and the per-subscription submission limit forces them into
a queue. That is minutes of waiting for data Azure could just as easily have written to a blob
overnight.

A scheduled export inverts it. Azure writes the data on its own timetable, and a refresh becomes
a blob read -- seconds, not minutes, and no rate limit to queue behind.

The thing that makes this possible here is **managed identity**. A Cost Management export
normally authenticates to its destination with a storage account key, and this tenant forces
`allowSharedKeyAccess=false` on every account, so the obvious approach fails with "Key-based
authentication is currently disabled". Creating the export with `identity: SystemAssigned` and
granting *that* identity Storage Blob Data Contributor sidesteps keys entirely. Verified working
on 2026-08-28.

One Azure limit shapes what this module offers:

  * **Each export covers one subscription.** Scheduling across an estate is one export per
    subscription, which is why `ensure` takes a list and reports per-subscription results.

It used to record a second: that FocusCost was unavailable at subscription scope. That was
never true — it was the pinned API version refusing it. See EXPORT_API below.
