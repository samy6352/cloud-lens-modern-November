"""Ingest Azure Cost Management **exports** from blob storage.

Why this exists
---------------
The `generateCostDetailsReport` API (see warehouse.py) generates a report per subscription per
period on demand. Measured on a real tenant that is ~115 seconds per subscription-month, so a
50-subscription customer wanting 12 months is roughly 19 hours of polling. That is fine for a
laptop demo and useless for an enterprise.

A **Cost Management export** inverts the cost model: Azure writes the data on a schedule, once,
at whatever scope you choose — subscription, resource group, management group or billing
account. Reading it is then just downloading files. One export at billing-account scope covers a
whole tenant, and a daily export keeps it current with no polling at all.

This module discovers exports, finds the newest run, and loads the files into the same `costs`
table the rest of the app already queries.

Access reality
--------------
In a governed tenant the export's storage account usually has `publicNetworkAccess=Disabled`, so
the blob data plane returns 403 from an ordinary workstation even for an owner. Verified on this
tenant. Two supported paths, in order:

  * **direct** — read blobs with the caller's AAD token. Works when the account allows access
    from where you are running (or you are inside the VNet / have a private endpoint).
  * **sas** — the operator supplies a container SAS URL. This is the pragmatic path for locked
    down accounts: a short-lived read-only SAS can be issued without changing network policy.

Both are read-only. Nothing here writes to storage.
