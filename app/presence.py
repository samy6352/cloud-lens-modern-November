"""Named resources and what they cost, so the dashboard need not read the detail table.

Why
---
`costs_rollup` deliberately refuses `count(DISTINCT "ResourceId")`: distinct counts
cannot be re-aggregated, because summing per-day distinct resources counts a
resource that ran all month thirty times. So those queries stayed on the detail
table -- and then *became* the dashboard's cost. Measured on 5,808,945 rows:

    the four distinct counts on the overview      61.5 s
    the per-region resource count beside them     55.6 s
    everything the rollup answers                  0.05 s

117 of the overview's 147 seconds were two queries counting resources.

What it is
----------
One row per distinct combination of the dimensions below, with the billed money
summed. Counting is exact rather than re-aggregated: `count(DISTINCT "ResourceId")`
over this table reads the same identities the detail table holds, because every
distinct combination that appears in `costs` appears here exactly once.

Why it now holds money
----------------------
It did not, originally, and the reasoning was that holding none kept it honest.
Measurement retired that argument. With the rollup carrying the tabs' money, one
query was left reading the detail table -- the per-resource "top resources" list,
because a resource's *name* and its individual cost live nowhere else:

    section(compute, 30d)            22.54 s total
      top resources (detail table)   19.19 s      <- 85% of the tab
      everything else                 3.35 s

The honesty argument does not actually apply to a sum. A distinct count cannot be
re-aggregated; a sum can, and exactly, because every row in `costs` falls into
exactly one group here. That is the same property `costs_rollup` already depends
on. What did have to be preserved is the narrower rule: money may only be read
from this table when the connection has not converted currency, because the
conversion factor is row-dependent on `PricingCurrency` and
`ExchangeRatePricingToBilling`, neither of which is in the grain. `serves_money`
is what decides, and `Warehouse._shadow_presence` nulls the measures rather than
projecting an unconverted number, so a mistake reads as missing and not as wrong.

The grain, and what it cost
---------------------------
Measured against the real estate before choosing it:

    (day, resource)                                 2,269,943
    + currency, subscription, region                2,270,556   +0.03%
    + service family                                2,783,883   +22.6%
    + service name, resource group, publisher       2,784,069   +0.007%
    + resource name                                 2,784,070   +0.00004%

Only `ServiceFamily` costs anything, because a resource is billed under several
families in a day while it sits in exactly one subscription, region and group. The
per-tab counts need that column, and once it is paid for the remaining three are
free -- so the grain is the whole set rather than a careful subset.

`ResourceName` adds a single row across the whole estate. 127 resource ids do carry
more than one name, but never within one day, so the day already in the grain
separates them; the one extra row is a resource renamed mid-day.

Rows with no `ResourceId` are kept rather than filtered out. `count(DISTINCT ...)`
ignores NULLs by itself, so keeping them cannot inflate a resource count; dropping
them *would* lose a service or a region that only ever appears on a
subscription-level charge, and the service and region counts beside the resource
count would quietly go missing -- and, now that the money is here too, the total
would be short by every subscription-level charge in the estate.
