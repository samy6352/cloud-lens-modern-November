<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Deploy CloudLens into an Azure subscription.

.DESCRIPTION
    Provisions the infrastructure from infra/main.bicep, grants the application's
    managed identity the Cost Management access it needs on the subscriptions it
    will analyse, and optionally publishes the application code.

    Safe to re-run: the Bicep deployment is incremental and the role assignments
    are idempotent.

.EXAMPLE
    ./infra/deploy.ps1 -Location centralindia

    ./infra/deploy.ps1 -Location eastus -ResourceGroup rg-cloudlens-prod `

    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Refuse to touch an app registration that is not a CloudLens sign-in app.

    .DESCRIPTION
        `-EntraClientId` exists so an identity team can create the registration and
        hand back its client id. The cost of that convenience is that a mistyped or
        pasted-from-the-wrong-window id names somebody else's application, and the
        three things this script then does to it are all silent and all wrong:

          * adds a redirect URI pointing at this deployment,
          * adds delegated Azure Resource Manager access,
          * grants tenant-wide administrator consent for *everything it requests*.

        The third is the severe one. `az ad app permission admin-consent` consents
        to the whole of `requiredResourceAccess`, so pointing this at an app that
        happens to request `Directory.ReadWrite.All` would grant that, to that app,
        for every user in the tenant -- from a typo, with no prompt.

        So the registration is read once and checked before anything is written to
        it. The checks are deliberately conservative: each one describes a property
        a genuine CloudLens sign-in registration has, and anything else is refused
        by name rather than adopted hopefully.
